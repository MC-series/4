The series blends sports with romance, making it both motivational and emotionally resonant.<br>
        What stands out in this drama is its lighthearted and relatable portrayal of youth. Bok Joo's character is strong yet vulnerable, giving viewers a refreshing break from typical K-drama heroines.
